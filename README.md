# J1939 Protocol Stack

This project provides the [documentation](https://microcontrol-germany.github.io/j1939-stack/) for the
MicroControl [J1939 protocol stack](https://www.microcontrol.net/en/portfolio/protocol-stacks/j1939/).
The J1939 protocol stack is independent from the used CAN hardware and operating system. Access to the CAN hardware
is done via the [CANpie FD API](https://canpie.github.io).
